•	What's the most important thing in your life?
I think the most important thing in my life is my relationship with a power greater than myself. I call that power God, but a rose by any other name smells as sweet. So call it whatever you want.
My version of my Higher Power is love. All encompassing, L.O.V.E.
Learning to love unconditionally here on earth brings me closer to the God of my understanding & helps me to love myself & everyone else. Even the people I do not like. Expecially, the people I do not like.
I think when I learn my lessons I will be called home, my job is to do my best while I am here & that is the most important thing to me.

•	Something interesting about yourself
