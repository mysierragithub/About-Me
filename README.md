##                       _Biography_

-My name is **Khoi Le**. Second year Sierra College's student.  This is my first time working with github.

-Always Remind other student that seeking help is not something to be ashamed of. In fact, students that are wise and perform well in college are the ones that seek help when they need it. If student is struggling academically or emotionally, encourage them to seek help from all the resources available including proctors, mentors, professors, Career Services and Health Services.

-I'm proficient with Microsoft Office suite including Word, Excel, and Power Point. I'm very comfortable using these programs and have a good length of times experience doing so. I'm very comfortable using computers and am confident in my ability to learn any new programs quickly. I have used many different computer programs, both computer and web-based. I'm comfortable both with the technology I know and with learning new programs .I am familiar with using both Microsoft and Apple operating software.I am very experienced in a variety of word processing programs and I'm an excellent typist. I can type quickly and without error.I'm a expert at Microsoft Excel and Mac Numbers. I can create fully-functional spreadsheets and am familiar with organizing and analyzing large sets of data.In addition to basic computer skills and word processing, I'm also familiar with photo and video editing software.

-I join in this class to better myself in school and at work from learning a new programming language

-Lazziness, over eating and lack of planning for the daymight prevent you from doing well in this class

-The most important thing in my life is my relationship with a power greater than myself. I call that power God, but a rose by any other name smells as sweet. So call it whatever you want.
My version of my Higher Power is love. All encompassing, L.O.V.E.
Learning to love unconditionally here on earth brings me closer to the God of my understanding & helps me to love myself & everyone else. Even the people I do not like. Expecially, the people I do not like.
I think when I learn my lessons I will be called home, my job is to do my best while I am here & that is the most important thing to me.

-Over all, I'm a Fun, Energetic and easy to get along with.  Love reading, fishing and exercising on my free time.
